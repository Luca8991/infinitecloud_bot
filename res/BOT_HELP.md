*SAVE FILES*:
1. send ONE FILE AT A TIME to the bot (the file could be any type of message: _text_, _audio_, _video_, _image_, _sticker_, etc.)
2. navigate to the directory you want to save it
3. click _HERE_ to select the current directory where to save the file
4. when asked, send the file name (name cannot include `/` character) WITHOUT extension
The file will be saved as with an extension that follows this table:
_image_ -> _.jpg_
_video_ -> _.mp4_
_audio_ -> same extension of the file you sent
_document_ -> same extension of the file you sent
_other_ -> _.tg+(type-of-message-you-sent)_

*CREATE DIRECTORY*:
Click _HERE_ where you want to create the directory and send the directory name when asked (name cannot include `/` character).

*MOVE FILES*:
The flow is almost the same as to save files.

*DELETE FILES/DIRECTORIES*:
Same as above

*RESTORE FILE SISTEM*:
If you unpinned or moved the filesystem, use this command to resend the filesystem to the bot.
